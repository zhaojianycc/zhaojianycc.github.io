= Biological Tissue Optical Transmission Model: RTE-Sim
=== Introduction 
Compact model for light propagation simulation in fNIRS systems. We offer both Matlab and Verilog-A version.

=== Background
RTE-Sim is an open-source compact model designed for light propagation simulation in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) systems. The goals for this compact model are:

The model offers a more efficient alternative to traditional numerical methods like the Finite Element Method (FEM) or Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for modeling light propagation in tissues.

The model is compatible with mainstream circuit design tools, making it valuable for achieving comprehensive simulations of the fNIRS system's signal chain.
